  * This is our "Firesheep" release.  It has numerous anti-firesheep
    improvements!
  * Split the stricter parts of the Facebook rule into a "Facebook+" rule.
    It's what's required to protect Facebook from Firesheep and similar cookie

    Fixes https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/1684
          https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=548102
    Thanks to Giorgio Maone and Boris Zbarsky!

      https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/1700
      https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/1672
      https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/1673
    The patch breaks toolbar search suggestions.  And who knows what else?
  * Don't send some country homepages to https://www.google.com/webhp?hl= ; 
    use https://encrypted.google.com instead

    hopefully fix https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/1649

    (it was pasted from Torbutton's cookie handling logic...)

    non-US users to encrypted.google.com rather than www.google.com

    - Mail.com logins

0.2.1:
  * Although google said https://www.google.com would continue to work, that
    wasn't absolutely true.
  * The new encyrpted.google.com seems to require queries to be #q=thing
    rather than search?q=thing, at least some of the time.  So let's do that.

0.2.0:
  * Work around the fact that Google does not allow client=firefox* HTTPS
    searches from outside the US, by rewriting those URIs
  * Add rules for:
    - Amazon
    - GMX
    - Live.com (Hotmail logins)
    - Meebo
    - the Netherlands Government

    language parameter

    install with it!

  * A bug in a user rules file should produce an error, rather than causing all
    rules to fail to load

0.1.1:
  * Generalise the Wikipedia rules to other Wikimedia services
  * In preferences window, add a link to instructions for writing one's own
    rules
